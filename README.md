# Pokemon test

Hello, my name is Santiago Arcos, even though I go a lot by "Pistachin".
This is the technical test I've done for you, I hope that you enjoy reviewing it as much as I did doing it!

## What are you going to find here

In this Readme I've included the last part of the given instructions and comments on those, a brief explanation (this) and the CRA README. It's always helpful to have that around if necessary.

So, I'll begin explaing something that you'll see more than once in my comments in your Instructions, that is the "Lack of Time" reason. For this test I have been asked to do it ASAP from last tuesday (03/11/2020) and I didn't really have any extra time these days, since I have to work, another technical test and most of my afternoons were already busy.

That is why, if you see "Lack of Time" it's because I have had to manage time the best way possible, and it has made me adapt to it, so some things are done different to how you asked them, in order to be faster. Starting by the CRA, which it was a bonus not to use, but it saves a lot of time.

I've also used Redux since I'm used to use it on a daily basis, and there's a really nice template with Redux.

The rest is commented below, right next to your instructions.

I'd like to add a small typo that I've found. In english the word 'abilities' doesn't have an H at the beginning.

# CRA Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
